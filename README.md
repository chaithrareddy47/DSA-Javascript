# 🧠 DSA Journey — Akshay Saini Series

## 📘 Overview
This repository is my personal log while learning Data Structures & Algorithms from Akshay Saini’s DSA playlist.  
I'm starting from absolute basics and documenting every concept, code, and problem I practice here.

## 🏁 Goal
- Build a strong DSA foundation  
- Practice daily coding  
- Prepare for interviews  
- Stay consistent 🚀

## 📚 Topics Covered
## Programming Basics  
    - Functions  
    - If / Else  
    - Loops
 ## DSA Math & Logic
    - Count digits
    - Sum of digit
    - Reverse a number

| Level    | Problem                     | Concepts                    | Status | Notes                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basics   | Print numbers 1 to 10       | for loop                    | ✅      | done, I first did manually then coded                     |
| Basics   | Print even numbers up to 20 | if + loop                   | ✅      | easy                                                      |
| Basics   | Print odd numbers up to 20  | if + loop                   | ✅      | easy                                                      |
| Basics   | Find sum of numbers 1 to N  | loop + variable             | ✅      | completed successfully                                    |
| DSA Math | Count digits in a number    | `%`, `/`, while loop        | ✅      | understood manually how digits are removed                |
| DSA Math | Sum of digits               | `%`, `/`, variable sum      | ✅      | learnt how remainder helps get each digit                 |
| DSA Math | Reverse a number            | `%`, `/`, `*10`, while loop | ✅      | realised why multiply by 10 is needed to shift digits     |
| DSA Math | Palindrome number           | reverse + compare           | ✅      | learnt why we store the original before reversing         |
| DSA Math | Count even & odd digits     | `%`, `/`, `if condition`    | ✅      | learnt to check each digit using `%2`                     |
| DSA Math | Product of digits           | `%`, `/`, `*`, while loop   | ✅      | understood why product starts from 1 not 0                |
| DSA Math | Armstrong number            | `%`, `/`, `**` (power)      | ✅      | understood how to raise each digit to count power and sum |

✅ Total Completed: 11 problems
🧠 Next Goal: Move to new topics — Strong Numbers, Factors, or Prime Numbers 💪


# 💡 Notes to Self
    - Always do problems manually first, before coding — helps understand loops and logic deeply.
    - %10 gives the last digit, /10 removes it.
    - For reverse number, *10 shifts digits left and creates space.
    - For Armstrong, count digits first, then raise each digit to that power.

## DSA isn’t tough — it just needs patience + practice + understanding ❤️
