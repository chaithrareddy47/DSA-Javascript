💡 Notes to Self

* Always do problems manually first, before coding — helps understand loops and logic deeply.
* %10 gives the last digit, /10 removes it.
* For reverse number, *10 shifts digits left and creates space.
* For Armstrong, count digits first, then raise each digit to that power.
* Arrays are easier because values are already separated — no need to extract digits.
* DSA isn’t tough — it just needs patience + practice + understanding ❤️
