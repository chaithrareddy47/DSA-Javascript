# 🧠 DSA Journey — Akshay Saini Series

## 📘 Overview
This repository is my personal log while learning Data Structures & Algorithms from Akshay Saini’s DSA playlist.  
I'm starting from absolute basics and documenting every concept, code, and problem I practice here.

## 🏁 Goal
- Build a strong DSA foundation  
- Practice daily coding  
- Prepare for interviews  
- Stay consistent 🚀

## 📚 Topics Covered
## Programming Basics  
    - Functions  
    - If / Else  
    - Loops
 ## DSA Math & Logic
    - Count digits
    - Sum of digit
    - Reverse a number

| Level    | Problem                     | Concepts                    | Status | Notes                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Basics   | Print numbers 1 to 10       | for loop                    | ✅      | done, I first did manually then coded                 |
| Basics   | Print even numbers up to 20 | if + loop                   | ✅      | easy                                                  |
| Basics   | Print odd numbers up to 20  | if + loop                   | ✅      | easy                                                  |
| Basics   | Find sum of numbers 1 to N  | loop + variable             | ✅      | completed successfully                                |
| DSA Math | Count digits in a number    | `%`, `/`, while loop        | ✅      | understood manually how digits are removed            |
| DSA Math | Sum of digits               | `%`, `/`, variable sum      | ✅      | learnt how remainder helps get each digit             |
| DSA Math | Reverse a number            | `%`, `/`, `*10`, while loop | ✅      | realised why multiply by 10 is needed to shift digits |

✅ Total Completed: 7 problems
🧠 Next Goal: Move to Palindrome Number & Armstrong Number (next level of digit problems)


# 💡 Notes to Self
   Always do problems manually first, before coding — helps understand loops and logic deeply.
   %10 gives the last digit, /10 removes it.
   For reverse number, *10 shifts digits left and creates space.
   DSA isn’t tough — it just needs patience + practice + understanding ❤️
