/*
return → gives value back to you → you can store it → reuse it anytime

 Imagine a coffee machine ☕️:

If it has a return, it gives you coffee in a cup — you can sip it whenever you want.

If it only does console.log, it just shows you a picture of coffee 😂 — every time you want to drink, you must press the button again.
